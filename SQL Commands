Some basics SQL Commands

1.Creating a database:

    create database database_name;
    for e.g you have to create database and name as BOAT 
    create database BOAT;

2.To show all databases:

    SHOW databases;
    for e.g you have to see all the databases that are present in your system then you will use SHOW databases;

3.To set Default database:

      Use database_name;
      for e.g you have to add the table into the BOAT databases then you will use the cmd Use BOAT;

4.To create table:

    create table table_name
    (
    column_name1 data_type(size) constraints,
    column_name2 data_type(size) constraints,
    column_name3 data_type(size) constraints,
    ....
    );
    for.eg you have to create the table name as sailors and into the BOAT databases then you will use the cmd such as
    CREATE TABLE sailors (
    ID int(60) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    ....
    );
  
3.Drop table or database:

    Drop table table_name;
    It drops the existing table and deleting a table will result in loss of complete information stored in the table.
    
    Drop database database_name;           
    It drops the existing database and you have admin privilege before dropping any database. Once a database is dropped, 
    you can check it in the list of databases with the following SQL command: SHOW DATABASES;
